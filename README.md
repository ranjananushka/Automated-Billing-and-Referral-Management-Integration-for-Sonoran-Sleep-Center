The Sonoran Sleep Center is currently experiencing billing inefficiencies, resulting in delays in payment processing and increased manual work for staff members. These issues have led to lost revenue opportunities. To address these challenges, we propose the implementation of an API integration between WayStar and InTakeQ, along with a referral management system.

The primary objectives of this project are to streamline processes, reduce manual labor, improve accuracy in payment processing and record-keeping, and enhance revenue cycle management. By implementing these improvements, the Sonoran Sleep Center aims to increase revenue opportunities, boost staff productivity, and optimize its overall revenue cycle.

Through the automation of payment posting, electronic record-keeping, and referral management processes, the center can significantly reduce processing time and manual labor, resulting in improved financial performance. The estimated duration of the project is approximately 135 days.
